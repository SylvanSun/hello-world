Learning how to use github...

So basically this tutorial teaches me about the basic functions of github and asks me to write about myself.
I myself is currently studying computer science at SJTU and preparing for a fundamental course called Data Structure in the upcoming semester.
I have known Github for quite a long time but never truely started learning how to use it.
So in this winter vacation after three decadent weeks(from Jan. 6th to Jan. 25th), I finally got the spirit to start something new.
I always lacked confidence in studying something new, but probably no time to hesitate....
